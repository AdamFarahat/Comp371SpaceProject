on windows with vscode:

download the cmake tools extension

download a c++ compiler

select the compiler as a kit in cmake tools extension window (in vscode while having this project open)

from there build and launch

will figure out the equivalent command prompt commands later

if you get build errors delete the build folder (happens when you move the project folder to another directory)
